Caged bird of a silkroad song
Heart-shaped your cage,
melted the swan of your soul
Trapped-lost in thee
where echoes the notes of a mystery music
So bright it resonates,
the haunted will follow your path don't know where
Will drown on to you
in reach hidden depths of your eyes's lose
The breathtaking paradise-bird withers unknown
Their sing's a returning of visions long gone
and chasing those visions will swell up my faith,
despite aching swords of heaven reject
